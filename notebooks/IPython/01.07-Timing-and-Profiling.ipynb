    "In the process of developing code and creating data processing pipelines, there are often trade-offs you can make between various implementations.\n",
    "Early in developing your algorithm, it can be counterproductive to worry about such things. As Donald Knuth famously quipped, \"We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "But once you have your code working, it can be useful to dig into its efficiency a bit.\n",
    "Sometimes it's useful to check the execution time of a given command or set of commands; other times it's useful to examine a multiline process and determine where the bottleneck lies in some complicated series of operations.\n",
    "IPython provides access to a wide array of functionality for this kind of timing and profiling of code.\n",
    "Here we'll discuss the following IPython magic commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `%time`: Time the execution of a single statement\n",
    "- `%timeit`: Time repeated execution of a single statement for more accuracy\n",
    "- `%prun`: Run code with the profiler\n",
    "- `%lprun`: Run code with the line-by-line profiler\n",
    "- `%memit`: Measure the memory use of a single statement\n",
    "- `%mprun`: Run code with the line-by-line memory profiler\n",
    "\n",
    "The last four commands are not bundled with IPython; to use them you'll need to get the `line_profiler` and `memory_profiler` extensions, which we will discuss in the following sections."
