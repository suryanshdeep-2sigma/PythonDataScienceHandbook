    "\n",
    "- *Sequential colormaps*: These are made up of one continuous sequence of colors (e.g., `binary` or `viridis`).\n",
    "- *Divergent colormaps*: These usually contain two distinct colors, which show positive and negative deviations from a mean (e.g., `RdBu` or `PuOr`).\n",
    "- *Qualitative colormaps*: These mix colors with no particular sequence (e.g., `rainbow` or `jet`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `jet` colormap, which was the default in Matplotlib prior to version 2.0, is an example of a qualitative colormap.\n",
    "Its status as the default was quite unfortunate, because qualitative maps are often a poor choice for representing quantitative data.\n",
    "Among the problems is the fact that qualitative maps usually do not display any uniform progression in brightness as the scale increases.\n",
